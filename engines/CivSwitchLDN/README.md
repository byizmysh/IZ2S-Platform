# CivSwitchLDN

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **[CivSwitch](https://github.com/Gezine/CivSwitch) is an exploit by [Gezine](https://github.com/Gezine).** This project delivers it through local wireless (LDN) :heart:.

## IZ2S Platform 0.22 integration

Use the platform's **First Setup** wizard rather than the standalone CLI instructions below. Import your own keys through the panel, prepare the displayed dependencies and permissions, and choose the Wi-Fi adapter. If Linux renumbers a reconnected adapter, the panel recovers the selection only when exactly one adapter is available; otherwise choose it explicitly.

The panel delivery wrapper isolates only the selected radio and retains Ethernet connectivity. It waits for Wi-Fi restoration before loader discovery. The upstream CLI section below retains its original network behavior. Save installation requires explicit confirmation and deletes single-player saves; make backups first. Later **Launch** connects through LAN or Wi-Fi to the saved loader without repeating LDN delivery.

## Demo (don't blink)

No capture card, sorry 🫣​​

## Requirements

- The **physical Switch 1 edition of Civilization VII, version 1.0.0**. See [CivSwitch](https://github.com/Gezine/CivSwitch#readme) for console firmware compatibility.
- A real Linux system (*WSL isn't supported yet*).
- Node.js 18+, Python 3.12+ with `venv`, and `setcap` (`libcap2-bin` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- A Switch 2, **on the same Wi-Fi network as the Linux system**.
- **Your own `prod.keys`, dumped from your own Switch 1.** Place it at the repository root before running.

## Usage

### 1. Install dependencies once.

```sh
npm install
```

Setup may ask for `sudo` to grant the Python helper its network permissions.

### 2. Setup the game

On the Switch, open Civilization VII and go to **MULTIPLAYER > WIRELESS > CREATE GAME (R stick press) > HOST LOBBY (+)**

### 3. Run the thing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NetworkManager will **temporarily disable all managed network connections** while the payload is sent over LDN. Afterwards, the script restores the previous Wi-Fi connection and waits for its IPv4 address before looking for the Remote JS Loader. If restoration fails, reconnect Wi-Fi manually before using the loader.

Leave the lobby open, then run:

```sh
npm start
```

The output shows connection and delivery steps, with warnings and errors when needed. For packet traces and diagnostics, run `npm start -- --verbose`.

### 4. Persist the exploit (optional)

After injection, the PC waits for the Remote JS Loader to respond on port 9026 before offering the persistent installer. Type **`y`** to install, or **`n`** to finish. If automatic discovery cannot identify the console, enter the IP displayed by the loader.

It will replace the game's single-player saves. Keep the game open until it prints **`INSTALL DONE`**. Afterwards, restart the game and select **Load Game** to start the loader again :tada:.

### Send JS payloads

Once the Remote JS Loader is running, send a JS file to the console IP shown on screen:

```sh
node send_payload.js <console-ip> payloads/helloworld.js
```

The JS file is optional (default: `payloads/helloworld.js`), as is a third port argument (default: `9026`).

## How it works

`run.js` handles the sequence:

1. Compress `payloads/core.js` into 19 chat messages.
2. Temporarily release Wi-Fi for LDN, scan nearby LDN networks, connect to the selected host, join its Civilization VII lobby and send the messages.
3. Close the LDN connection and attempt to restore networking, including on failure or interruption.
4. Wait for the Remote JS Loader on port 9026 after networking is restored, then offer Gezine's persistent installer.

## Troubleshooting

Use `--verbose` to see a timestamped trace of all packets exchanged with the lobby.

```sh
npm start -- --verbose
```

If the exploit fails on your hardware, try slowing down the handshake with `--handshake-scale` (default: 1.0). For example, `3` triples the delays between registration messages:

```sh
npm start -- --handshake-scale 3
```

You can adjust the delay between chat messages (default: 10 ms):

```sh
npm start -- --chat-delay 50
```
